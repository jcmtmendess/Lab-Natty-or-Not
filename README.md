Presenting: The Fungi Farmer Chatbot 🍄

## 📒 Descrição
Development of a chatbot to simulate an AI assistant and creation of a YouTube video showcasing it's introduction. 

## 🤖 Tecnologias Utilizadas
Chat GPT 3.5 - script and review
Eleven Labs - text to speech
D-ID - video generator
Zapier AI - ChatBot

## 🧐 Processo de Criação
Starting from an existing project, I had the idea to create a chatbot assistant to enhance the user experience for a mobile app, a real project I'm developing. To bring this vision to life, I utilized  ChatGPT to script the chatbot's dialogue. This allowed me to craft natural, engaging conversations that the chatbot could have with users. To give the chatbot a lifelike and personable voice, I integrated ElevenLabs' text-to-speech technology. This transformed the ChatGPT-generated script into a high-quality audio output. Finally, I used the D-ID platform to create a dynamic video presentation of the chatbot. This allowed me to pair the ElevenLabs audio with an animated, virtual character that could introduce itself and explain its capabilities to users in an engaging, visual format.
By combining these innovative tools and technologies, I presented this chatbot which is poised to be a valuable asset, offering personalized support and guidance to enhance the overall user journey.

The promt I used for the script was:

"Write a script for a short YouTube video, acting like you were talking to someone who know nothing about the subject. Use the items on {SUMMARY} for the {SCRIPT}

{SUMMARY}
[Authority] Fungi Farmer Chatbot, the ultimate expert on mycology
[Avatar] Substrate platform users
[Issue] How to use the Chatbot 

{SCRIPT}
Hello! I am [Authority] and I'm here to help [Avatar]
Today we will resolve [Issue].

{RULES}
Follow the {SCRIPT} and replace the elements between [ ] for those listed above on {SUMMARY}
Use simple analogies and hyperboles
Make the video short and simple, with just one scene."


Also, I've built the ChatBot itself, in a simple version, to simulate the real one, using Zapier AI.

## 💭 Reflexão (Opcional)
I learned how to improve the prompts to build a script for my video, Utilizing the 3R's technique was a game-changer, allowing me to build a script for the chatbot video that felt natural and engaging.. This was my first time employing this structured approach to prompt engineering, and I was pleasantly surprised by the results. While I did need to make some adjustments along the way, the 3R's framework provided a solid foundation that helped me generate ideas and refine the chatbot's dialogue. Bringing the chatbot I imagined to life with a human-sounding voice  was a particularly rewarding aspect of this project. Navigating the full lifecycle of ideation, development, and production also deepened my understanding of the complexities involved in creating AI-powered experiences. This project has been a great learning experience that has expanded my horizons. The future is bright, and I can't wait to see what I'll create next! 😄
